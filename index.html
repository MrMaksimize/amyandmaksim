                      The specific where's, how's and why's aren't that important (and probably not too interesting to people who are not either of them). They were best friends for years in Chicago before either of them realized they had been crazy about each other for most of that time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He visited her in the hospital every day and her family could not convince her that his feelings for her were anything other than platonic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      They made a list of places to travel to together as buddies before they realized they wanted to go there as husband and wife.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      She cried when she told him she had feelings for him, certain she was losing her best friend. He convinced her otherwise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He told her she'd never learn how to spell "Pecherskiy" when she first met him. Now she's taking it as her last name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He's the kindest, most selfless person she knows. And the dorkiest.
                    <p>
                      He feels the same way about her.

                  We want to thank everyone for being so supportive. Your love means everything to us.  We look at our wedding day as most importantly a celebration with our loved ones, all of whom have been such integral parts of our lives--in both our individual paths and our united journey together.  Every one of you has helped shape who we are as individuals and a couple. We cannot express how thankful we are for each of you.  We would like to especially thank a few people for their incredible help with the wedding:

                    We thank you, first and foremost, for being a superior example of what it means to be a true, genuine, and good person.  We both strive to live our lives with a fraction of your integrity and sweetness.  You have been a vital source of support for both of us during our toughest times, and an essential supplier of laughter and smiles.  We cannot begin to thank you for the mountain of love and inspiration you have given to both of us, as well as your never-ending generosity.  Our hearts are full with you in our lives.

                    Это преуменьшением сказать, что  ты сыгралa важную роль в жизни Максима, и, конечно, в более широком смысле, его жизнь с Эми. Ты  нам всегда доешь потрясающую русскую еду (с вегетарианскими вариантами для Эми) и мешки яблок, предлагаешь слова ободрения и поддержки в нужное время, ты любящая и заботливая мамa для нас обоих.

Нам всегда очень нравится приезжать в ваш дом, и чуствавать запах вкусной Российской еды цветов. Когда-нибудь, Максим и Эми надеемся, что будет кактусный сад, который немного  сравнивает с вашим, и Эми надеется рассказать вам все о нем на русском языке.

                    Erica Isabela/Gmez, it is safe to say that we do not know where we would be without you.  You have helped us to grow into real, live adults (more or less) and been a constant, true friend and sister to both of us.  Although we spend an inordinate amount of time discussing your cooking, it is truly your heart of gold and shoulders of support that we could not live without. Also, this wedding--and all its last-minute planning--would probably have gone off the rails without your guidance and assistance.  So thanks for that.

You have been indispensable in helping us plan this crazy shindig and most other trips and adventures we have taken.  And of course, thank you for the rides in your 2012 Buick LaCrosse.

                    As stated above, you are a pretty important part of the ceremony.  We're grateful that you've stepped up to the plate as officiant and made the last-minute planning much smoother and (relatively) stress-free with your advice and support. Beyond that, we want to thank you for your encouragement of the relationship even when it seemed to take an uncertain turn.  We also wanted to thank you and Rebecca for bringing Nora into our lives.  We like her a whole lot.

                     Upon hearing of our short engagement and soon-to-be wedding, you immediately insisted on making the invitations, despite the last-minute circumstances.  What you came up with was more beautiful and impressive (and seen here in the background) than we could've imagined.  The time and effort you put into it at such a busy time of year (hello, Thanksgiving and Christmas) is not lost on us.

You have helped us, separately and in our relationship, more than we could ever say.  You've also made us laugh uncontrollably on a regular basis. We love you and look forward to a lifetime of adorable, best friend moments with you. Like the elephant herd, we have formed deep family bonds with you.  They cannot be broken--you're stuck with us.

Ever since that time when Maksim partied myself homeless and he picked him up wearing his leather jacket in 80 degree heat, he has been there for him whenever he needed help.  When he met Amy, he would not stay quiet about how wonderful she is.  On top of all that he's anamzing and talented DJ and will be spinning the music at our wedding!

Although they cannot be here physically, their love will absolutely  be felt in spirit.  We wish you were here for this, but we are so grateful for all the times you've been there for us. Thanks for all the love and laughs from our far-away loved ones:
